Pre-playtest:
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal.

During-playtest:
- End cutscenes
- Secret end
- Inflation sound entering clementsparrow's level
- Require both paths for bottom left arm secret (also, going back through clickmazes)
- Can skip over lock at bottom left arm secret
- Exit from secret next to first room
- Check for missing respawns


Level ideas:
- Infinite loop
- Can you get knocked off a conveyor by a block behind you?
