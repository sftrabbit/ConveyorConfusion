Pre-playtest:
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal.

During-playtest:
- End cutscenes
- Secret end
- Should I change the secrets to be in-PuzzleScript?
- Intro area and finish areas feel kinda slow


Level ideas:
- Infinite loop
- Can you get knocked off a conveyor by a block behind you?
