During-playtest:
- End cutscenes
- Secret end
- Inflation sound entering clementsparrow's level
- Require both paths for bottom left arm secret (also, going back through clickmazes)
- Can skip over lock at bottom left arm secret
- Check for missing respawns
- Tracking of diagonal-moving blocks in merge branch (let's just hack it together - keep note of when a "block release" region has been exited and then when entering the gate room just set up the tracker then)
- Locatable secret indicators
- Add final sjm secret
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal.
