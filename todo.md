Pre-playtest:
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal.

During-playtest:
- End cutscenes
- Secret end
- Inflation sound entering clementsparrow's level
- Require both paths for bottom left arm secret
- Can skip over lock at bottom left arm secret
- Exit from secret next to first room
- Potentially move secret next to first room into the merge path


Level ideas:
- Infinite loop
- Can you get knocked off a conveyor by a block behind you?
