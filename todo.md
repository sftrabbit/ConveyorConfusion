- Cool hat on restart
- Helper functions?
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal.

Bugs:
- Post-Nogg player ghost
- Stevenjmiller bonus 2 secret loses power in adjacent level
- Block release from Ethan Clark's level has visual glitch
- Game pad secret doesn't register
- Better reverse traversal in intro

Maybe:
- Leave credits?
- Slowness in branch endings?
- Sound when going from Deusovi to Gamepad secret
- Sound when going from Merge Path 4 to Merge Path 3
- Sound when going from branch A exit path to Corey Hardt
- Sound when going from inflatable intro to clementsparrow
- Sound when going from clock to KirraLuan
- Theme2 covering stevenjmiller bonus 2
