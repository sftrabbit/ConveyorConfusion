Pre-playtest:
- Don't save until we've stopped againing
- Camera wrong position after continue
- Belt noise in Jack Lance's level, also in my sticky intro level
- Why is it slower after continue? Is it?
- Go through, make sure regions are all good. Check resets. Check backwards traversal. Split up intro region?
- Slow reset
- Check in Firefox/IE/Safari
- Deusovi's level seems broken

During-playtest:
- Vat falling behaviour
- End cutscenes
- Secret end
- Tracking for merging and explosions and stuff (do we even need it?)
- Do the overhead walls need a tutorial?
- Should I change the secrets to be in-PuzzleScript?
- Blocks leave mark where they started?

Level ideas:
- Infinite loop
- Can you get knocked off a conveyor by a block behind you?
